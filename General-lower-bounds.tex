\section{Lower bounds}



\begin{proposition}
	The "target reachability problem" (asking whether there is a run in which all agents reach a state $q_f$) is undecidable for BNRA with two registers.
\end{proposition}

\ifproofs
\begin{proof}
	\cortoin{TODO}
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
	\label{prop:reduction-LCS}
	There is a polynomial-time reduction from the coverability problem for lossy channel systems to the coverability problem for BNRA with two registers.
\end{proposition}

\ifproofs
\begin{proof}
	\cortoin{TODO}
\end{proof}
\fi

\begin{remark}
	The reduction presented in the proof of Proposition~\ref{prop:reduction-LCS} can be adapted to show that the repeat coverability problem is undecidable for BNRA, as it is for LCS.
\end{remark}
