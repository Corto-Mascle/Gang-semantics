	% 	We consider the parameterized verification of a model representing an arbitrarily large network of agents which communicate by broadcasting and receiving messages. The broadcast topology is reconfigurable, hence a message sent may be received by any set of agents.

	% 	We consider the coverability problem, where one asks whether a given state of the system may be reached by at least one agent. We show that this problem is decidable; however, it is as hard as coverability in lossy channel systems, which is non-primitive recursive. 
	% 	We also consider other classical problems on such systems, in particular the target problem where all processes must synchronize on a given state. This problem is however undecidable for our model.

	\begin{abstract}
	We consider the parameterized verification of arbitrarily large networks of agents which communicate by broadcasting and receiving messages. In our model, the broadcast topology is reconfigurable so that a sent message can be received by any set of agents. In addition, agents have local registers which are initially distinct and may therefore be thought of as identifiers.
	When an agent broadcasts a message, it appends to the message the value stored in one of its registers. Upon reception, an agent can store the received value or test this value for equality with one of its own registers. 

	We consider the coverability problem, where one asks whether a given state of the system may be reached by at least one agent. We establish that this problem is decidable; however, it is as hard as coverability in lossy channel systems, which is non-primitive recursive. 
	This model lies at the frontier of decidability as other classical problems on this model are undecidable; this is in particular true for the target problem where all processes must synchronize on a given state. 
	By contrast, we show that the coverability problem is \NP-complete when each agent has only one register.

	\section{Conclusion}
	We have established the decidability and $\Fcomplexity{\omega^\omega}$-completeness of the coverability problem for BNRA, as well as the \NP-completeness of the problem for 1-BNRA.
	One may want to enrich the transition systems of our protocols, for instance to pushdown automata. While this adds little difficulty in the general case (it suffices to extend Lemma~\ref{lem:short-local-runs} to pushdown protocols using a classical cut-hill argument), the case of one register may be trickier.
	Another open problem is the complexity of the target problem with one register. While we can show that this is a decidable problem, its exact complexity is unclear. 
	Finally, one may want to extend this model with inequality tests, as in classical related models such as data nets.
