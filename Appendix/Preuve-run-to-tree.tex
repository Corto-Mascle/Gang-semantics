\subsection{Proof of Lemma~\ref{lem:run-to-tree}}

\LemRunToTree*

\begin{proof}
	
	We proceed by strong induction on the lexicographic order on $\nats \times \set{\text{follower}, \text{boss}}$ with the length of the run as first component and the type of specification as second component, ``boss'' being considered higher than ``follower'' (so that, for a fixed "run" length, we prove it for "boss specifications" then for "follower specifications"). 
	
	If $\spec = \epsilon$ is an empty "boss specification" then the tree with a single node labelled with an empty run and an empty specification satisfies it.
	This covers in particular the case of a run of length $0$, as they cannot satisfy any other specification.
	Let $\run$ be a run, and assume that the property is true for runs whose length is less than the one of $\run$. Write $\agents$ the set of agents of $\run$.
	
	Because $\run$ satisfies $\spec$, there exists a value $v$ and an agent $a$ in $\run$ such that:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item if $\spec= \bossspec$ is a "boss specification", $\bossspec$ is a subword of the sequence of messages sent with value $v$ in $\run$ and $a$ is the agent for which $v$ is an "initial value",
	\item if $\spec$ is a "follower specification" $(\followwordspec, \followmessagespec)$, then $a$ is an agent which $v$-input is a subword of $\followwordspec$ and that broadcasts $\followmessagespec$ with value $v$. 
	\end{itemize}

	Observe that, if the last step of $u$ does not include a broadcast with value $v$, then the run obtained by deleting this last step also satisfies the specification so we directly call the induction hypothesis on this new run. From now on, we will assume that the last step of $\run$ involves a broadcast with value $v$. 

	Let $u$ the local run of $a$ in $\run$. We will build the root $\node$ of our tree $\tree$ to have local run $u$, value $v$ and "specification" $\spec$. 

	The construction is as follows.
	For every $v' \ne v$ a "non-initial" value of $a$ in $\run$, we do the following. Let $w$ the sequence of messages sent with value $v'$ in $\run$ by agents in $\agents \setminus \set{a}$; $\vinput{v'}{u}$ is a subword of $w$. Because the last step of $\run$ has value $v$, we apply the induction hypothesis to obtain an "unfolding tree" $\tree'$ whose root is a boss node with boss specification $\vinput{v'}{u}$, and we attach $\tree'$ below $\node$ in $\tree$.


	For every $v'$ "initial" value of $a$ in $\run$, we do the following.  
	Let $\mathsf{ext} \in \messages^*$ the sequence of "message types" sent in $\run$ with value $v'$ by agents other that $a$. Let $m_1, \dots, m_\ell \in \messages$ distinct message types so that $m_i$ is the $i$-th message type to appear in $\mathsf{ext}$; in particular, we have $\ell \leq \size{\messages}$. 
	Let $a_i$ the first agent other than $a$ to broadcast $m_i$ with value $v'$ in $\run$. For every $i \in \nset{0}{\ell}$, let $u_i$ the run between the first broadcast of $m_i$ (included) and the first broadcast of $m_{i+1}$ (excluded) by agents of $\agents \setminus \set{a}$ (before $m_1$ for $i=0$, after $m_\ell$ for $i = \ell$) and let $w_i$ the sequence of messages broadcast by $a$ in $u_i$. This forms a "decomposition" $\decsymb := (w_0, m_1, w_1, \ldots, m_\ell, w_\ell)$.
	For all $i \in \nset{1}{\ell}$, we write $\decsymb_i$ for the "decomposition" $\decsymb = (w_0, m_1, w_1, \ldots, m_{i-1}, w_{i-1})$.   Let $\run_i$ be the prefix of $\run$ up until the first broadcast of $m_i$ with value $v'$ (included), and $w'_i$ the $v'$-input of $a_i$ in $\run_i$. Agent $a_i$ is a witness that $\run_i$ satisfied "follower specification" $(w'_i, m_i)$. 
	If $\run_i$ is strictly shorter than $\run$, then by applying the induction we obtain an "unfolding tree" $\tree_i$ satisfying "follower specification" $(w_i', m_i)$. If $\run_i = \run$, then $\run$ ends with a broadcast $(m_\ell,v')$ by agent $a_\ell$; because the last step of $\run$ is a broadcast with value $v$, this implies $v = v'$ therefore $v$ is initial for $a$, which may happen only when $\spec$ is a "boss specification". In that case, because in our induction order "boss specifications" are above "follower specifications", we can also apply the induction hypothesis and obtain an "unfolding tree" $\tree_l$ satisfying "follower specification" $(w_\ell', m_\ell)$. Either way, we have obtained, for every $i \in \nset{1}{\ell}$, an "unfolding tree" $\tree_i$ satisfying "follower specification" $(w_i', m_i)$, which we attach below $\node$. 
	
	We claim that the tree constructed satisfies conditions \ref{item:condition1_non_initial_value} to \ref{item:condition4_boss_node} thus is an "unfolding tree". It suffices to check the conditions at the root $\node$, as all we did is attach "unfolding trees" below that root. 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Condition \ref{item:condition1_non_initial_value} is satisfied by construction of the trees $\tree'$.
	\item For condition \ref{item:condition2_initial_value}, let $v'$ an initial value of $a$ in $u$. We reuse the notations from above. $u$ may be split into successive runs $u_0, \dots, u_\ell$. Moreover, $w_i  = \voutput{v'}{u_i}$ by definition and $\vinput{v}{u_i} \in \set{m_1,\dots,m_{i-1}}$ because $u_i$ is before the first broadcast of $m_i$ by some agent other that $a$. Also, for every $i$, $\tree_i$ satisfies follower specification $(w_i',m_i)$ but $w_i' \in \langdec{\decsymb_i}$ and $w_i'$ is the $v'$-input of $a_i$ in $\run_i$ hence $w_i' \in \langdec{\decsymb_i}$.
	\item Condition \ref{item:condition3_follower_node}, assuming that $\spec$ is a "follower specification" $(\followwordspec, \followmessagespec)$, is a direct consequence of $a$ being a witness that $\run$ satisfies $(\followwordspec, \followmessagespec)$ with value $v$. 
	\item For condition \ref{item:condition4_boss_node}, assume that $\spec$ is a "boss specification" $\bossspec$. Because $a$ with value $v$ is a witness that $\run$ satisfies $\bossspec$, $v$ is an initial value of $a$. Moreover, let $w$ the sequence of messages broadcast with value $v$ in $\run$ (by all agents). 
	Because $\run$ satisfies $\bossspec$, $\bossspec \subword w$. However, $w \in \langdec{\decsymb}$ by construction of $\decsymb$, therefore $w \in \langdec{\decsymb}$.
	\end{itemize}

	We have therefore built an "unfolding tree" $\tree$ satisfying $\spec$.
