\begin{corollary}
	\label{cor:removing_diseq_tests}
	Let $(\prot, q_f)$ an instance of the "coverability problem". This instance is positive if and only if $(\tilde{\prot}, q_f)$ is positive, where $\tilde{\prot}$ is equal to $\prot$ where every disequality test $\quotemarks{\diseqtestact}$ is replaced by dummy action $\quotemarks{\dummyact}$.  
\end{corollary}

\ifproofs
\begin{proof}
	First, if $(\prot, q_f)$ is positive then so is $(\tilde{\prot}, q_f)$, as one can easily lift any "run" in $\prot$ to an equivalent "run" in $\tilde{\prot}$ (transitions are less guarded  in $\tilde{\prot}$ that in $\prot$). 
	
	Suppose now that $(\tilde{\prot}, q_f)$ is a positive instance of the "coverability problem". There exists a "run" $\tilde{\run}: \tilde{\config}_0 \step{*} \tilde{\config}$ in $\tilde{\prot}$ that covers $q_f$. We prove by induction on the length of $\tilde{\run}$ that there exists a "run" $\run$ reaching a configuration $\config$ such that $\tilde{\config} \lessthan \config$ (Remark~\ref{rem:bigger_config_query} then allows us to conclude). 
	
	If $\config = \config_0$ then $\run = \tilde{\run}$ suffices. Suppose that $\tilde{\run}$ has length $k \geq 1$, and that the result if true for "runs" of length $k-1$. Decompose $\tilde{\run}$ into $\tilde{\run_{k-1}}: \tilde{\config_0} \step{*} \tilde{\config_{k-1}}$ of length $k-1$ and a final step $\tilde{\config_{k-1}} \step{} \tilde{\config_k}$. 
	By induction hypothesis, there exists $\run_{k-1}: \config_0 \step{*} \config_{k-1}$ such that $\tilde{\config_{k-1}} \lessthan \config_{k-1}$: there exists an injective function $\pi : \tilde{\agents} \rightarrow \agents$
	such that, for all $a \in \tilde{\agents}$, $\tilde{\config_{k-1}}(a) = \config_{k-1}(\pi(a))$, where $\tilde{\agents} := \agentsof{\tilde{\run}}$ and $\agents := \agentsof{\run}$. If $\tilde{\config_{k-1}} \step{} \tilde{\config_k}$ involves no reception transition from $\tilde{\prot}$ whose corresponding transition in $\prot$ has action $\quotemarks{\diseqtestact}$, then we directly lift this step into a step appended at the end of $\run_{k-1}$ (making $\pi(a)$ take a transition whenever $a$ does so in $\tilde{\config_{k-1}} \step{} \tilde{\config_k}$). Otherwise, write $\tilde{\agents}_{\diseqtestact}$ the subset of $\tilde{\agents}$ corresponding to agents taking in $\tilde{\config_{k-1}} \step{} \tilde{\config_k}$ a reception transition from $\tilde{\prot}$ whose corresponding transition in $\prot$ has action $\quotemarks{\diseqtestact}$ . Write $(q, \brone{m}, q') \in \transitions$ the broadcast transition used in this step.  Using the copycat principle, we add to $\config_{k-1}$ a fresh agent $a_{\mathsf{new}}$ with state $q$ and a register value that does not appear in $\config_{k-1}$. 
	We first mimic this broadcast step at the end of $\run_{k-1}$, making any agent $\pi(a) \in \pi(\tilde{\agents} \setminus \tilde{\agents}_{\diseqtestact})$ take the transition that $a$ takes in $\tilde{\config_{k-1}} \step{} \tilde{\config_k}$. We then add a new step where $a_{\mathsf{new}}$ broadcasts using transition $(q, \brone{m}, q')$, and every agent $\pi(a) \in \pi(\tilde{\agents}_{\diseqtestact})$ takes the transition corresponding to the transition taken by $a$ in $\tilde{\config_{k-1}} \step{} \tilde{\config_k}$. Such a transition is a reception with action $\quotemarks{\diseqtestact}$ in $\prot$; however, because $a_{\mathsf{new}}$ does not share its register value with any process from $\tilde{\agents}$, all disequality conditions are satisfied and this step is valid. In this end, every agent $\pi(a) \in \pi(\tilde{\agents})$ has taken the transition in $\prot$ corresponding to the one $a$ took in $\tilde{\prot}$ in step $\tilde{\config_{k-1}} \step{} \tilde{\config_k}$, hence the configuration $\config_k$ reached by the constructed run is such that $\tilde{\config_k} \lessthan \config_k$.
