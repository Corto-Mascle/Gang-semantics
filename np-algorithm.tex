%\subsection{Conclusion}


As we proved our abstraction to be safe and complete, by Lemma \ref{lem:short-run}, we can guess an abstract run of at most $(|Q| + 2)^3$ steps leading to an abstract configuration in which $q_f$ appears. As a result, we find an NP-algorithm for our problem of interest.

In the appendix, we present a reduction of 3-SAT to our problem, which proves that the "coverability problem" is NP-hard. As a result, we get to the main result of this section.

\begin{theorem}
	\label{thm:np-complete-query-cover}
	The "coverability problem" is \NP-complete for "protocols" with one register.
\end{theorem}
