\begin{proposition}
	\label{prop:sound-and-complete}
	Let $K$ be a set of states, there exists a reachable "configuration" satisfying $K$ if and only if there exists a reachable "abstract configuration" $(S,b,K')$ with either $K \subseteq K'$ or $b \neq \noboss$ and $K \subseteq K' \cup \set{b}$.  
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	The right-to-left direction is given by Corollary~\ref{cor:soundness}.
	
	For the left-to-right direction, let $\run$ be a run ending in a configuration $\config$ satisfying $K$. Let $v \in \nats$ be such that $\config$ has some agents with value $v$ in every state of $K$.
	
	We construct a suitable "abstract run" as follows: by Lemma~\ref{lem:abstraction_complete} there exists an abstract run from some $\sigma_0 \in \aconfiginitset$ to an abstract configuration $\absproj{v}{\run} = (S, b, K')$.
	
	As $\config, v$ satisfies $K$, for all $s \in K$ either $s = b$ or $s \neq b$ and there exists an agent with state $s$ and value $v$ in $\config$. 	
	By definition of the abstraction $\absproj{v}{\run}$, we have $K \subseteq K'$ if $b=\noboss$ and $K \subseteq K' \cup \set{b}$ otherwise, proving the proposition.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
	\label{thm:np-complete-query-cover}
	The "query coverability problem" is \np-complete for "protocols" with one register.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	The lower bound is given by Proposition~\ref{prop:np-hard-query-cover}.
	For the upper bound, say we are given a "protocol" $\prot = (Q, \messages, \Delta, q_0)$ and a "query" $\phi$.
	We start by decomposing $\phi$ into cliques $K_1, \ldots, K_p$ in polynomial time, as in Lemma~\ref{lem:query-decomposition}.
	For each $i$, we have to verify that there exists a reachable configuration $\config_i$ satisfying $K_i$. By Proposition~\ref{prop:sound-and-complete}, it is the case if and only if there is an "abstract run" to an "abstract configuration" $(S,b, K)$ with either $K_i \subseteq K$ or $b\neq \noboss$ and $K_i \subseteq K\cup\set{b}$.
	Furthermore, by Lemma~\ref{lem:short-run} if there is such an "abstract run" then there is one with at most $(\size{Q}+2)^3$ steps. 
	Thus we can simply guess such an abstract run and verify it in polynomial time.
	As a result, the "query coverability problem" is in \np.
