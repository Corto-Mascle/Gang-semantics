	\section{Introduction}
	
	Broadcast networks were introduced in ??. Then RBN ?? were extensively studied. One weakness is that agents are not identified, while in other models they are $\to$ dynamic models with registers ??
	
	\begin{definition}
		A \emph{Broadcast network with registers} is ... + ref
	\end{definition}
	
	\textbf{EXAMPLES}
	
	We can check that several messages come from the same agent, we can get confirmations that a message was received.
	We can form chains of agents echoing a flow of information.
	
	\begin{theorem}
		There is a PTIME reduction from LCS to BNRA.
	\end{theorem}
	
	\begin{definition}
		The coverability problem is...
	\end{definition}
	
	\section{With one register per agent}
	
	When an agent stores a new value it forgets its identity and becomes "copycatable"
	
	In NP by a clique abstraction, NP-complete by a 3SAT reduction
	
	\section{With more than one register per agent}
	
	\textbf{To simplify, we assume that agents only broadcast with their original identifiers}
	
	\begin{definition}
		(Informal def) Tree unfolding -> Figure ! (only boss nodes)
		Nodes = local runs
		Children = sources of messages received
	\end{definition} 
	
	\begin{lemma}
		There exists a run covering $q_f$ if and only if there exists a finite tree unfolding whose root covers $q_f$
	\end{lemma}
	
	We want to bound the size of a tree unfolding.
	
	\begin{remark}
		If a descendant broadcasts more than an ancestor, we can shorten the tree.
	\end{remark}
	
	WQO theory tells us that the subword ordering is a wqo and thus that we can bound the size of a tree branch if we can bound its nth node by a function of $n$.
	
	\begin{lemma}
		Local bound + figure
	\end{lemma}
	
	We get the result, but the general case is harder
	
	(Decidability comes from Cover + Parameterized +  Unreliable broadcasts => Copycat. Target is undecidable)
