\lemShorteningBranches*

\begin{proof}
	Let $\tree_{\node}$, $\tree_{\node'}$ be the subtrees rooted in $\node$, $\node'$ respectively. 
	Let $\tree'$ be the tree obtained by replacing $\tree_{\node}$ with $\tree_{\node'}$; it is strictly smaller than $\tree$. We prove that $\tree'$ is an "unfolding tree".
	The only problematic node is the parent of $\node$ if it exists, because it does not have the same children in $\tree$ and in $\tree'$. Assume that $\node$ is not the root of $\tree$, and let $\node_p$ its parent in $\tree'$.
	The only problematic values are the ones that had $\node$ as witness in conditions \ref{item:condition1_non_initial_value} (if $\node$ is a "boss node") and \ref{item:condition2_initial_value} (if $\node$ is a "follower node"). Let $v$ such a value. 
	If $\node$ is a "boss node" ($v$ is non-initial), we have $\vinput{v}{\localrunlabel{\node_p}} \subword \bosslabel{\node} \subword \bosslabel{\node'}$ hence condition \ref{item:condition1_non_initial_value} is also satisfied. If $\node$ is a "follower node" ($v$ is initial), then, reusing the notations of condition \ref{item:condition2_initial_value}, $\node$ was such that $\followlabelmessage{\node} = m_i$ and $\followlabelword{\node} \in \langdec{\decsymb_i}$. In this case, we also have $\followlabelmessage{\node'} = m_i$ and, because $\followlabelword{\node'} \subword \followlabelword{\node}$ and $\langdec{\decsymb_i}$ is closed by subword, we have $\followlabelword{\node'} \in \langdec{\decsymb_i}$ and condition \ref{item:condition2_initial_value} is satisfied. In both cases, $\tree'$ is an "unfolding tree" with the same root specification as $\tree$ hence a "coverability witness".
	% Note that condition \ref{item:condition3_follower_node} is satisfied at $\node''$ in $\tree'$ because its "local run" and "specification" did not change from $\tree$ to $\tree'$, and that \ref{item:condition4_boss_node} is satisfied at $\node''$ in $\tree'$ because its "local run", "specification" and the corresponding "decomposition" did not change from $\tree$ to $\tree'$.  
	% As a result, in both cases $\tree'$ is a "unfolding tree" smaller than $\tree$ that satisfies $\spec$, which concludes the proof. 
\end{proof}
