\subsection{Construction of an "initial run" from an "unfolding tree"}
\label{app:tree-to-run}

\begin{restatable}{lemma}{LemTreeToRun}
	\label{lem:tree-to-run}
	If there exists an "unfolding tree" over $\prot$ satisfying a "boss specification" $\bossspec \in \messages^*$ then there exists an "initial run" $\run$ of $\prot$ satisfying $\bossspec$.
\end{restatable}

We start by defining "partial runs", which are "runs" where some receptions are not matched by broadcasts. Intuitively, this will allow us to build "partial runs" from "unfolding trees" whose root is a "follower node", which implicitly rely on their parent for some broadcasts. We will therefore construct inductively "partial runs" from nodes of the tree; we will obtain complete "runs" by matching reception and broadcasts of different "partial runs".

\begin{definition}
	Let $\config, \config'$ two configurations. 
	
	A ""partial step"" $\config \pstep{} \config'$ is defined if either $\config \step{} \config'$ (normal "step") or there exist $m \in \messages$, $v\in \nats$ such that for all agent $a$ either $\config(a) = \config'(a)$ or $\config(a) \extbr{\delta}{v} \config'(a)$ with $\delta$ a transition receiving "message type" $m$ (""unmatched reception"").
	
	\AP A ""partial run"" is a sequence of "partial steps".
	Note that a "local run" can be seen as a "partial run" with a single agent. A "partial run" is ""initial@@partial"" if it starts in an "initial configuration".
	The \reintro{$v$-input} $\reintro*\vinput{v}{\run}$ of a "partial run" $\run$ is the sequence $m_0 \cdots m_k$ of "message types" corresponding to "unmatched receptions" with value $v$ in $\run$. Its \reintro{$v$-output} $\reintro*\voutput{v}{\run}$ is the sequence of "message types" corresponding to "broadcasts" with value $v$ in $\run$.
\end{definition}


We will prove the following, more general version of Lemma~\ref{lem:tree-to-run}:

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:tree-to-run-technical}
For every "unfolding tree" $\tree$:
\begin{itemize}
	\item if $\tree$ satisfies a "boss specification" $\bossspec \in \messages^*$, then there exists an "initial run" $\run$ satisfying $\bossspec$,
	\item if $\tree$ satisfies a "follower specification" $(\followwordspec, \followmessagespec)$ then there exist an "initial partial run" $\run$ and a value $v$ such that:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item all "unmatched receptions" in $\run$ are with value $v$,
	\item $\vinput{v}{\run} \subword \followwordspec$, 
	\item $\voutput{v}{\run}$ contains $\followmessagespec$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We prove it by induction on the "size" of the "unfolding tree".
Let $\tree$ be a "unfolding tree", $\node$ its root, $u := \localrunlabel{\node}$ and $V$ the set of values appearing in $u$. 
We will combine $u$ with runs given by children of $\node$ to construct $\run$ satisfying the desired property. We build $\rho$ inductively in two steps. 

\subsubsection{Step 1: "Non-initial Values"}
\label{sec:tree-to-run-step-one}

For each non-initial value $v \ne \valuelabel{\node}$ of $u$, $\node$ has a "boss" child of specification $w$ such that $\vinput{v}{u} \subword w$.
By induction hypothesis, there is an "initial run" $\run'$ satisfying "boss specification" $w$. Up to renaming agents, assume that $\run$ and $\run'$ have disjoint agents.
We rename values in $\run'$ so that $w$ is broadcast in $\run'$ with value $v$, and $\run'$ has no other shared value with $\run$. 
We use the broadcasts made by $\run'$ to match the "unmatched receptions" with value $v$ in $\run$: this gives us a new partial "run" $\run$ with no "unmatched reception" with value $v$ and whose behaviour on other values of $V$ is the same as before.

\subsubsection{Step 2: "Initial Values"}
\label{sec:tree-to-run-step-two}

% We proceed in the same way as in the previous part: the goal is now to use the "partial runs" yielded by the "follower" children to eliminate the "input@@partial" over each "non-initial@@partial" value of $u$, except maybe for $\valuelabel{\node}$, which requires a special case.

Let $v$ be an "initial value" of $u$, and $\decsymb = \\(w_0, m_1, w_1, \ldots, m_\ell, w_\ell)$ the "decomposition" from condition \ref{item:condition2_initial_value}. We have that, for all $j \in \nset{1}{\ell}$, $\node$ has a "follower" child $\node_j$ labelled by $\followlabelmessage{\node_j} = m_j$ and $\followlabelword{\node_j} \in \langdec{\decsymb_j}$ with $\decsymb_j = (w_0, m_1, w_1, \ldots, m_{j-1}, w_{j-1})$. 

The behavior of the run $\run$ with respect to $v$ is the one of $u$, as we have not added any broadcasts or receptions with $v$. Hence we can split $\run$ into $\run_0, \ldots, \run_\ell$ with $w_i \subword \voutput{\aval}{\run_i}$ and $\vinput{\aval}{\run_i} \in \set{m_1, \dots, m_{i}}^*$ for all $i$.

By induction hypothesis applied to $\node_j$, for all $j$, there exists an "initial partial run" $\Tilde{\run}_j$ whose only "unmatched receptions" are on $v$, $\vinput{v}{\Tilde{\run_j}} \subword \followlabelword{\node_{j}}$ and such that $\Tilde{\run}_j$ broadcasts $(m_j,v)$ in its last step. Again, we rename agents and values so that the sets of agents of $\run$ and of every $\Tilde{\run_j}$ are all disjoint and the only shared value between any of these runs is $v$.
As $\followlabelword{\node_{j}} \in \langdec{\decsymb_j}$ and $\vinput{v}{\Tilde{\run_j}} \subword \followlabelword{\node_{j}}$, we can split $\Tilde{\run}_j$ into $\Tilde{\run}_{j, 0}, \ldots, \Tilde{\run}_{j,j-1}$ so that  $\vinput{v}{\Tilde{\run}_{j, i}} \subword \Tilde{w}_{j,i}$ where $\Tilde{w}_{j,i}$ can be obtained by adding letters from $\set{m_1, \ldots, m_j}$ to $w_i$.

We use the following composition operation: consider $\run$ and one of the $\Tilde{\run}_j$. We can design a new run in which we execute both runs in parallel over disjoint sets of agents. We match each $\Tilde{\run}_{j, i}$ with $\run_i$ so that the broadcasts of $\run_i$ with value $v$ forming $w_i$ are received in $\Tilde{\run}_{j, i}$ and the only remaining missing broadcasts in that section of the run are of $m_1, \ldots, m_i$. 
We obtain a run section whose $v$-"output" still contains $w_i$ and whose "$v$-input" only contains $m_1, \ldots, m_i$.
This lets us get to a point where the next step in $\Tilde{\run}_j$ is a broadcast $(m_j,v)$ and $\run$ has been executed up to the beginning of $\run_j$. We may then use the $(m_j,v)$ broadcast at any moment in the rest of $\run$ either to complete an "unmatched reception" or to extend the "$v$-output" of $\run$.


 This construction is illustrated in Figure
 \begin{figure}
	 	\input{../Figures/Fig-tree-to-run}
	 	\caption{An illustration of the composition operation from the proof of Lemma~\ref{lem:tree-to-run}}
	 	\label{fig:tree-to-run}
	 \end{figure}

The resulting run $\run'$ can still be split into $\run'_0 \cdots \run'_\ell$ where $w_i \subword \voutput{\aval}{\run_i}$ and $\vinput{\aval}{\run_i} \in \set{m_1, \dots, m_{i}}^*$ for all $i$. Its input on all values other than $v$ is the same as the one of $\run$. This procedure can thus be iterated.

If $\val = \valuelabel{\node}$ then we have $\bosslabel{\node} \in \langdec{\decsymb}$, and we need to ensure that $\bosslabel{\node}$ is broadcast in $\run$ with value $\val$.
Let $\bossspec_0, \ldots, \bossspec_\ell$ such that $\bosslabel{\node} \subword \bossspec_0\cdots\bossspec_\ell$ and for all $j$, $\bossspec_j$ can be obtained by adding letters from $\set{m_1,\ldots, m_j}$ in $w_j$.
We use the composition operation to extend the output of $\run$, so that $\bossspec_i \subword \voutput{v}{\run_i}$ for all $i$.

Then, in all cases, we apply the composition as many times as necessary to match the "unmatched receptions": while there is an "unmatched reception" of some $(m_j,v)$ we compose $\run$ with $\Tilde{\run}_j$ to eliminate it. We may be adding some "unmatched receptions" of $(m_i, v)$ for some $i<j$.
This procedure terminates as the number of "unmatched receptions" of $m_\ell, \ldots, m_1$ decreases at each iteration for the lexicographic ordering.

In the end we obtain a run $\run$ with no "unmatched reception" on $v$, and such that, if $v = \valuelabel{\node}$ and $\node$ is a "boss node", $\bosslabel{\node} \subword \voutput{v}{\run}$.

% induction on $j$. At induction step $j$, we prove that we can combine $\Tilde{\run}_1$ to $\Tilde{\run}_j$ with $\run_0$ to $\run_j$ into $\run_j'$ which has no "unmatched receptions" on value $v$ and has the same behavior as $\run$ on values in $V \setminus \set{v}$. Moreover, $\run_j'$ has a broadcast of every $(m_i,v)$ with $i \leq j$ and this broadcast comes from an agent for which $v$ is non-initial. 

%The initialization of our induction simply consists in taking $\run_0$, which has no "unmatched reception" with value $v$. For the induction step, suppose we have constructed $\run'_j$ for some $j$. We observe that for every $i \leq j$, there is in $\run_j'$ a broadcast of $(m_i,v)$ by some agent $a_i$ (which originally appeared in $\Tilde{\run_i}$) for which $v$ is non-initial, so that we can consider that we have an unlimited supply of messages $(m_i,v)$ by duplicating this agent. 
%To build $\run_{j+1}'$, we first append $\Tilde{\run}_{j+1}$ at the end of $\run_j'$; because $\vinput{v}{\Tilde{\run}_{j+1}} \in \langdec{\decsymb_{j+1}}$, all "unmatched receptions" in $\Tilde{\run}_{j+1}$ can be matched with broadcasts already in $\run_j'$ (duplicating some agents $a_i$ if needed). Observe that $\Tilde{\run}_{j+1}$ has a broadcast  $(m_{j+1},v)$ by some agent $a_{j+1}$ for which $v$ is non-initial. We then append $\run_{j+1}$ at the end of the obtained $\run_{j+1}'$: all its "unmatched receptions" on value $v$ are of the form $(m_i,v)$ with $i \leq j+1$ so they can be matched by duplicating $a_i$. This conclude the construction of $\run_{j+1}'$. In particular, $\run_{\ell}'$ has no "unmatched reception" on $v$ and behaves the same as $\run$ for values in $V \setminus \set{v}$, this concludes step $2$.

 


 
\subsubsection{Concluding the procedure}
We distinguish two cases depending on the type of "specification" of $\node$.
\begin{itemize}
\item If $\node$ is a "boss node" of "boss specification" $\bossspec$, we apply steps $1$ and $2$ to every value in $V$, which can be done because $\valuelabel{\node}$ is initial in $\localrun$. We then obtain an "initial run" $\run$ with no "unmatched receptions" satisfying "boss specification" $\bossspec$ for value $\valuelabel{\node}$.
\item if $\node$ is a "follower node", we apply steps $1$ and $2$ to every value in $V \setminus \set{\valuelabel{\node}}$ to obtain a "partial run" $\run$ with no "unmatched reception" on values different from $\valuelabel{\node}$. Moreover, because the behavior of $\run$ with respect to $\valuelabel{\node}$ is the one of $\localrun$, we have that $\vinput{\valuelabel{\node}}{\run} \subword \followwordspec$ and $\voutput{\valuelabel{\node}}{\run}$ contains $\followmessagespec$, concluding the proof. 
\end{itemize}
