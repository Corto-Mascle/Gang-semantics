% We start with a few definitions. 
% First, we define the local run of an agent in a "run", which is the "local run" induced by the sequence of transitions taken by that agent through the run, along with the received messages.

%corresponds to the intuitive idea that a "local run" is used to describe the point of view of a single agent in a "run". Given a run $\run: \config_0 \step{} \config_1 \step{} \cdots \step{}\config_n$ and a agent $a$, the "local run" $\localrun$ of $a$ in $\run$ is defined by induction. The "local run" of $a$ in an empty run $\config_0$ is the empty local run $\config_0(a)$. Let $\localrun_i$ the local run of $a$ in $\config_0 \step{*} \config_i$ (prefix of length $i$ of $\run$). We define $\localrun_{i+1}$ as follows:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item if in $\config_i \step{} \config_{i+1}$, $a$ performs a "reception" with a transition $\atrans$ then, by letting $\aval$ the value of the message received, $u_{i+1}$ is $u_i$ to which a step labeled by $\step{\extlabel{\atrans}{\aval}}$ is appended,
%\item if $\config_i \step{} \config_{i+1}$ does not involve $a$, then $u_{i+1} := u_i$.
%\end{itemize}

We make the meaning of the "specification" labels more concrete by defining the criteria for an "initial run" to satisfy a "specification".

\begin{itemize}
	\item A "run" $\run$ satisfies a "boss specification" $\bossspec$ if there exists $\aval \in \nats$ such that $\bossspec$ is a subword of the sequence of messages sent with value $\aval$ in $\run$.
	
	\item A "run" $\run$ satisfies a "follower specification" $(\followwordspec, \followmessagespec)$ if there exist a value $\aval$ and an agent $a$ such that $\aval$ is not an initial value of $a$, the $\aval$-"input" of $a$ in $\run$ is a subword of $\followwordspec$ and agent $a$ broadcasts $\followmessagespec$ with value $\aval$ at some point.
\end{itemize}

For an "unfolding tree", satisfying a "specification" simply means that its root is labeled with that "specification" or a better one.

\begin{itemize}
	\item An "unfolding tree" satisfies a "boss specification" $\bossspec$ if its root $\node$ is a "boss node" and $\bossspec$ is a subword of its "specification" label $\bosslabel{\node}$.
	
	\item An "unfolding tree" satisfies a "follower specification" $(\followwordspec, \followmessagespec)$ if its root $\node$ is a "follower node" such that $\followmessagespec=\followlabelmessage{\node}$ and  $\followlabelword{\node}$ is a subword of $\followwordspec$.
\end{itemize}

Note that \COVER redcues to the existence of an "initial run" satisfying a "boss specification": it suffices to add a loop on $q_f$ broadcasting $m_f \notin \messages$. Therefore, it suffices to prove that "initial runs" of $\prot$ and "unfolding trees" satisfy the same "boss specifications". We prove the two directions in the two following sections: we construct an "unfolding tree" from a "run" in  Section~\ref{app:run-to-tree} and a "run" from an "unfolding tree" in Section~\ref{app:tree-to-run}.

%\begin{restatable}{lemma}{LemRunToTree}
%	\label{lem:run-to-tree}
%	If there exists an "initial run" $\run$ of $\prot$ satisfying some "specification" $\spec$ then there exists a finite "unfolding tree" $\tree$ over $\prot$ satisfying $\spec$.
%\end{restatable}

%\begin{restatable}{lemma}{LemTreeToRun}
%	\label{lem:tree-to-run}
%	If there exists an "unfolding tree" over $\prot$ satisfying a "boss specification" $\bossspec \in \messages^*$ then there exists a finite "initial run" $\run$ of $\prot$ satisfying $\bossspec$.
%\end{restatable}
