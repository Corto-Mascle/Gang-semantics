\begin{lemma}
	\label{lem:run-to-tree}
	If there exists an "initial run" $\run$ of $\prot$ satisfying some "specification" $\spec$ then there exists a finite "unfolding tree" $\tree$ over $\prot$ satisfying $\spec$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	
	We proceed by strong induction on $\nats \times \set{\text{follower}, \text{boss}}$ ordered by lexicographic order (follower being lower than boss). The first component is the length of the "run" and the second component is the type of "specification".This means that, for a fixed "run" length, we prove our property for "boss specifications" then for "follower specifications". 
	
	If $\run$ is of length $0$, then its specification must be an empty "boss specification" and the tree with a single node labeled with an empty "local run" and an empty "specification" satisfies it.

	Let $\run$ be an "initial run", and assume that the property is true for "initial runs" whose length is less than the one of $\run$. Write $\agents$ the set of agents of $\run$.
	Because $\run$ satisfies $\spec$, there exist a value $v$ and an agent $a$ in $\run$ such that:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item if $\spec$ is a "boss specification" $\bossspec$, $\bossspec$ is a subword of the sequence of "message types" sent with value $v$ in $\run$ and $a$ is the agent which has $v$ as an "initial value",
	\item if $\spec$ is a "follower specification" $(\followwordspec, \followmessagespec)$, then $a$ is an agent whose $v$-"input" is a subword of $\followwordspec$ and that broadcasts $\followmessagespec$ with value $v$. 
	\end{itemize}

	If the last step of $u$ does not include a broadcast with value $v$, then we remove it and apply the induction hypothesis. Assume that the last step of $\run$ involves a broadcast with value $v$. 
	Let $u$ the "local run" of $a$ in $\run$. We set the root $\node$ of our tree $\tree$ to have local run $u$, value $v$ and "specification" $\spec$ as labels, and attach subtrees to it so that it forms an "unfolding tree".

	We do the following for every value $v'$ in $u$.
	If $v'$ is "non-initial" in $u$, then $v' \ne v$; because the last "step" of $\run$ is a broadcast with value $v$, we apply the induction hypothesis on $\run$ without its last step to obtain an "unfolding tree" $\tree'$ whose root is a "boss node" with "boss specification" $\vinput{v'}{u}$, and we attach $\tree'$ below $\node$ in $\tree$.
	Assume now that $v'$ is "initial" in $u$. We split $\run$ according to the first broadcast of each message type by agents other than $a$; we obtain $m_1, \dots, m_\ell \in \messages$ distinct message types such that $\run = \run_0 \cdot \run_1 \cdot \ldots \cdot \run_\ell$ where, for all $i \in \nset{1}{l}$:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item agents from $\agents \setminus \set{a}$ do not broadcast $m_i$ with value $v'$ in $\run_0 \cdot \ldots \cdot \run_{i-1}$,
	\item $\run_i$ starts with a broadcast of $m_i$ with value $v'$ by some agent $a_i \in \agents \setminus \set{a}$.
	\end{itemize} 
	
	Let $w_i$ the sequence broadcast by $a$ with value $v'$ in $\run_i$. This forms a "decomposition" $\decsymb := (w_0, m_1, w_1, \ldots, m_\ell, w_\ell)$.
	For all $i \in \nset{1}{\ell}$, we write $\decsymb_i$ for the "decomposition" $\decsymb_i = (w_0, m_1, w_1, \ldots, m_{i-1}, w_{i-1})$. 
	For every $i \in \nset{1}{\ell-1}$, let $\tilde{\run}_i$ the run $\run_0 \cdot \ldots \cdot \run_{i-1}$ plus the first step of $\run_i$ (where $(m_i,v')$ is broadcast).
	Let $w_i'$ the $v'$-"input" of $a_i$ in $\tilde{\run}_i$: it is in $\langdec{\decsymb_i}$ by construction of $\decsymb$. Agent $a_i$ is a witness that $\tilde{\run}_i$ satisfies "follower specification" $(w'_i, m_i)$. 
	If $\tilde{\run_i}$ is smaller than $\run$, we apply the induction hypothesis and obtain an "unfolding tree" $\tree_i$ satisfying "follower specification" $(w_i', m_i)$. If $\tilde{\run_i} = \run$, then $i = \ell$, $v'=v$ ($\run$ ends with a broadcast with value $v$) and $\run$ ends with a broadcast $(m_\ell,v)$ by agent $a_\ell$. Moreover, since $v'=v$ then $v$ is "initial" for $a$ and $\spec$ is a "boss specification" $\bossspec$. Because in our induction order "boss specifications" are above "follower specifications", we can apply the induction hypothesis and obtain an "unfolding tree" $\tree_\ell$ satisfying "follower specification" $(w_\ell', m_\ell)$. We have obtained, for every $i \in \nset{1}{\ell}$, an "unfolding tree" $\tree_i$ satisfying "follower specification" $(w_i', m_i)$, which we attach below $\node$. 
	
	Overall we have attached one "boss node" below $\node$ for each non-initial value in $u$, thanks to which \ref{item:condition1_non_initial_value} is satisfied at $\node$, and at most $\size{\messages}$ "follower nodes" below $\node$ for each initial value in $u$, thanks to which \ref{item:condition2_initial_value} is satisfied as well. Conditions \ref{item:condition3_follower_node} and \ref{item:condition4_boss_node} because $\run$ satisfies $\spec$ for agent $a$.
	We have therefore built an "unfolding tree" $\tree$ satisfying $\spec$. 
	% We claim that the tree constructed satisfies conditions \ref{item:condition1_non_initial_value} to \ref{item:condition4_boss_node} thus is an "unfolding tree". It suffices to check the conditions at the root $\node$, as all we did is attach "unfolding trees" below that root. 
	% \begin{itemize}
	% \item Condition \ref{item:condition1_non_initial_value} is satisfied by construction of the trees $\tree'$.
	% \item For condition \ref{item:condition2_initial_value}, let $v'$ an initial value of $a$ in $u$. We reuse the notations from above. $u$ may be split into successive "local runs" $u_0, \dots, u_\ell$. Moreover, $w_i  = \voutput{v'}{u_i}$ by definition and $\vinput{v}{u_i} \in \set{m_1,\dots,m_{i-1}}$ because $u_i$ is before the first broadcast of $m_i$ by some agent other that $a$. Also, for every $i$, $\tree_i$ satisfies "follower specification" $(w_i',m_i)$ and $w_i'$ is the $v'$-"input" of $a_i$ in $\run_i$ hence $w_i' \in \langdec{\decsymb_i}$.
	% \item Condition \ref{item:condition3_follower_node}, assuming that $\spec$ is a "follower specification" $(\followwordspec, \followmessagespec)$, is immediate as we selected $a$  to be a witness that $\run$ satisfies $(\followwordspec, \followmessagespec)$ with value $v$. 
	% \item For condition \ref{item:condition4_boss_node}, assume that $\spec$ is a "boss specification" $\bossspec$. We selected $a$ so that $v$ is an initial value of $a$. Let $w$ the sequence of messages broadcast with value $v$ in $\run$ (by all agents). 
	% Because $\run$ satisfies $\bossspec$, $\bossspec \subword w$. Moreover, $w \in \langdec{\decsymb}$ by construction of $\decsymb$, therefore $w \in \langdec{\decsymb}$.
	% \end{itemize}
	% We have therefore built an "unfolding tree" $\tree$ satisfying $\spec$.
