	We simplify our notations for "protocols" with one register.
	We do not consider "local tests" in this part, as with a single register every local equality test is satisfied and every local disequality test is not.
	Hence we can delete transitions with disequality tests and replace equality tests with $\varepsilon$-transitions, which can be eliminated with a quadratic blow-up as in non-deterministic finite automata.
	
	Furthermore, the register argument in receptions and broadcasts is always $1$, hence we remove it.
	Our new set of operations is 
	\[
	Op^{\messages} = \set{\brone{\amessage}, \recone{\amessage}{\dummyact}, \recone{\amessage}{\enregact}, \recone{\amessage}{\eqtestact}, \recone{\amessage}{\diseqtestact} \mid \amessage \in \messages}
	\]
	
	Given a "configuration" $\config$, we write $\data{\config}(a)$ for $\data{\config}(a,1)$.
