\subsection{Undecidability of \Target}
\label{sec:undec-target}

The "target reachability problem" is a natural next step after coverability. 
It requires a more precise description of runs: while for \COVER we can produce a lot of waste, in the sense that we can add as many agents as we need to ensure that one of them reaches the given state, for \Target we need to guarantee that those agents can later reach the target state.

We show that \Target is undecidable for BNRAs, which suggests that while we can obtain decidability of \COVER thanks to the monotonicity of the problem, we cannot analyse precisely the set of runs of such systems.


\begin{restatable}{proposition}{propTargetUndecidable}
\label{prop:target-undec}
	The "target reachability problem" (asking whether there is a run in which all agents reach a state $q_f$) is undecidable for \BNRA with two registers.
\end{restatable}
