\subsection{Undecidability of \Target}
\label{sec:undec-target}

The proof of the undecidability of \Target~is left in the appendix. Intuitively, the abstraction for the "cover problem" does not hold anymore because here, we can not spawn agents with a specific task and not follow what they will do afterwards. We need to verify the objective: each agent must reach $q_f$.  

\luin{je s√®che un peu sur quoi dire pour target...}

\begin{restatable}{proposition}{propTargetUndecidable}
\label{prop:target-undec}
	The "target reachability problem" (asking whether there is a run in which all agents reach a state $q_f$) is undecidable for \BNRA with two registers.
\end{restatable}
