\section{Introduction}

\cortoin{plagiat}
We introduce a formal model of data-sensitive distributed protocols, called Broad-
cast Networks of Register Automata (BNRA), aimed at modelling both the local
knowledge of distributed nodes as well as their interaction via broadcast com-
munication. 


A network is modelled via a finite graph where each node runs an
instance of a common protocol. A protocol is specified via a register automaton,
an automaton equipped with a finite set of registers [20]. Each register assumes
values taken from the set of natural numbers. Node interaction is specified via
broadcast communication, well-suited to model scenarios in which individual
nodes have partial information aboutDST-RP13 the network topology. Messages are al-
lowed to carry data, that can be assigned to or tested against the local registers
of receivers. 

Dynamic updates of the current configuration are modelled via
non-deterministic reconfigurations of the underlying connectivity graph. A node
may disconnect from its neighbours and connect to other ones at any time of the
execution. This behaviour models in a natural way unexpected power-off and
dynamic movement of devices. The resulting model can be used to reason about
core parts of client-server protocols as well as of routing protocols, e.g. route
maintainance as in Link Reversal Routing.

We study a model representing networks of processes communicating by broadcast. We make no assumption on the evolution of the communication graph, i.e., when a process broadcasts a message, each other process, may receive it or not, independently. This models unreliable systems, with unexpected crashes and disconnections, in a pessimistic way. 
Furthermore, each agent has access to some local registers, containing natural numbers (initially, identifiers). Each broadcast from an agent consists in a message from a finite alphabet and a value from one of their registers. The agents receiving it may store the value in their registers or compare it with its register contents. 
This allows an agent, for instance, to check that a sequence of messages all come from the same agent.

\cortoin{TO CONTINUE}

This model was introduced in \cite{DST2013}, as a natural extension of Reconfigurable Broadcast Networks. That paper claimed that the coverability problem, i.e., the problem of finding a run from an initial configuration to one where at least one agent is in a designated state, was decidable and even \PSPACE-complete, but the proof turned out to be wrong. As we will see, the complexity of that problem is actually much higher.

In this paper we establish the decidability of the coverability problem. We even prove its completeness for the HyperAckermannian complexity class $\Falpha{\omega^\omega}$, thereby establishing that the problem requires a non-multiply recursive amount of time, and that it is in some sense as hard as lossy channel systems \corto{ref}. 
We contrast it with the undecidability of the target problem (asking for a run at the end of which all agents are in a given state) on one side, and with the \NP-completeness of the cover ability problem when each agent has only one register.
