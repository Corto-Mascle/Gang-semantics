\section{Lower bounds}

\begin{ex}
	In some cases a protocol may require a "run" of exponential length (in the number of states) to reach a configuration satisfying a "query".
	
	\begin{figure}[h]

	\end{figure}

	Consider the "protocol" displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:exp-run}. 
	For all $n \in \set{0, \ldots, N+1}$ we call \emph{future} of $n$ the set of states accessible from state $n$ by a path in the protocol.
	
	There is an initial run covering $N+1$: we start with $2^{N+1}$ agents, which we pair two by two. We make each agent broadcast $m_0$ while its partner receives it, storing its register value and broadcasts $m'_0$, which the first one receives. After doing that with all pairs of agents we have $2^{N}$ agents in state $1$.
	We repeat this process to put $2^{N+1-n}$ agents in state $n$ for each $n$, one after the other. In the end we have an agent in state $N+1$.
	
	We show by induction on $n$ that for all $k \in \nats$, any reachable configuration with at least $k$ agents in states of the future of $n$ has at least $k(2^n-1)$ agents in states $\set{q_i \mid i<n}$.
	
	For $n=0$ this is immediate. Let $n>0$, suppose the property true for $n-1$, then let $k \in \nats$ and let $\config$ be a configuration with at least $k$ agents in the future of $n$. Let $\agents_+$ be the set of those agents, let $a_+ \in \agents_+$, $a_+$ has taken the transitions broadcasting $m_{n-1}$ and receiving $m'_{n-1}$ with its own register value. As it never changed its identifier, the reception must contain its initial value $r$. Hence there exists an agent $a_-$ which broadcasts $m'_{n-1}$ at some point while having value $r$. All such $a_-$ are distinct as they all broadcast only once with $m'_{n-1}$ and the $a_+$ have distinct initial values.
	Hence there are at least $k$ agents in state $q_{n-1}$, hence at least $2k$ in the future of $n-1$. By induction hypothesis this means there are $2k(2^{n-1}-1) = k(2^n-2)$ in $\set{q_i \mid i<n-1}$, thus at least $k(2^n-1)$ in $\set{q_i \mid i<n}$.
	
	As a consequence, any initial run covering $N+1$ needs to send at least $2^N-1$ agents to the $q_i$ states, hence it needs to be exponentially long as each of those agents needs to execute at least one broadcast.

\begin{proposition}
	\label{prop:np-hard-query-cover}
	The "query coverability problem" is \np-hard.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	\begin{figure}[h]
		\input{Figures/fig-np-hard}
		\label{fig:np-hard}
		\caption{The "protocol" used for the \np-hardness proof.}
	\end{figure}
	
	We reduce from the 3SAT problem.
	Let $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ be variables and $\query = \bigwedge_{j=1}^m C_j$ with, for all $j$, $C_j = \ell_j^1 \lor \ell_j^2 \lor \ell_j^3$ and $\ell_j^1, \ell_j^2, \ell_j^3 \in \set{x_i, \neg x_i \mid 1 \leq i \leq n}$. 

	Consider the "protocol" displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:np-hard}.
	Our alphabet of messages is the set of literals $\set{x_i, \neg x_i \mid 1 \leq i \leq n}$.
	Each agent may either receive a message, and repeat it forever or it may broadcast one of $x_i, \neg x_i$ for each $i$ and then try to receive a message one of $\ell_j^1, \ell_j^2, \ell_j^3$ for each $j$, with its own register value.
	
	Suppose $\query$ is satisfiable, let $\nu$ be a satisfying assignment, then we set $\agents = \set{a, a_1, \ldots, a_n}$ as our set of agents. First for each $i$ we make $a$ broadcast $x_i$ if $\nu(x_i)= \top$ and $\neg x_i$ otherwise, and $a_i$ only receive it (and go to the corresponding state).
	Then for each $j$ we select some $\ell_j^p$ satisfied by $\nu$. There exists $i$ such that $a_i$ is in state $\ell_j^p$. It broadcasts $\ell_j^p$ along with the initial register value of $a$, allowing $a$ to go to the next state.
	
	As a result, there is an execution in which agent $a$ reaches $m'$.
	
	Now suppose there is an execution $\run$ over some set of agents $\agents$ such that some agent $a \in \agents$ is in state $m'$ in the final configuration.
	For each $i$, $a$ has broadcast either $x_i$ or $\neg x_i$, but not both.
	Let $\nu$ be the valuation assigning $\top$ to $x_i$ if and only if $a$ has broadcast it.
	The register of $a$ cannot have changed its value throughout the run. 
	For each $j$ it has received one of $\ell_j^1, \ell_j^2, \ell_j^3$ along with its own initial register value (which we call $r$). Let $p_j$ be such that $a$ has received $\ell_j^{p_j}$.
	Hence for all $j$ there exists an agent $a_j \in \agents$ such that at some point in the run the register value of $a_j$ is $r$ and $a_j$ broadcasts $\ell_j^{p_j}$.
	This agent $a_j$ must be in state $\ell_j^{p_j}$ after receiving the broadcast $\br{\ell_j^{p_j}}$ from $a$ (as all agents start with different register values).
	Hence $\ell_j^{p_j}$ is satisfied by $\nu$. 
	
	As a result, $\nu$ satisfies a literal of each clause of $\query$, and thus satisfies $\query$. This concludes our reduction
\end{proof}
